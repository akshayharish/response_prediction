# Marketing Campaign Response Prediction
This was a group project to predict the response of retail customers to markting campaigns.

A two-step approah was built:
a) The customers were segmented using the demographic data using K-means clustering. Data distribution within these segments were understood.
b) Secondly, Linear regression and Decision Tree models were built for each of these segments using the previous responses to marketing activities.

Results of the regression can be interpretted and applied directly to enhance better response to these marketing campaigns.
