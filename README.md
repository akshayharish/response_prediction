# Marketing Campaign Response Prediction
This was a group project to predict the response of retail customers to markting campaigns.

A two-step approah was built: <br/>
a) The customers were segmented using the demographic data using K-means clustering. Data distribution within these segments were understood.<br/>
b) Secondly, Linear regression and Decision Tree models were built for each of these segments using the previous responses to marketing activities.<br/>

Results of the regression can be interpretted and applied directly to enhance better response to these marketing campaigns.
